    <h2>Que-8 How to check version of React Js?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The package.json file in your project directory contains the version information for all the dependencies, including React.</p>
    <li>Open the package.json file in the root directory of your React project.</li>
    <li>Look for the react and react-dom entries under the dependencies section.</li>
    <h3>Ex:</h3>
    <pre>
        {
            "dependencies": {
              "react": "^18.2.0",
              "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
              // other dependencies
            }
          }
          
    </pre>
    <strong>The version number next to react and react-dom indicates the version of React.js that is installed.</strong>
