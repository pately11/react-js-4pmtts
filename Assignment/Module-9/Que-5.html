    <h2>Que-5 What is Components in React Js?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>n React.js, components are the fundamental building blocks used to create user interfaces. A React application is typically made up of multiple components, each responsible for rendering a small, reusable piece of the UI. Components in React help in organizing the UI into independent, isolated, and reusable parts, making it easier to build and maintain complex applications.</p>
    <p>Types of components:</p>
    <li><strong>Functional Components:</strong>These are the most common type of components in modern React. They are simply JavaScript functions that accept props (properties) as an argument and return a React element (usually JSX).</li>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
   <pre>function Greeting(props) {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;
  }
  </pre>
  <li><strong>Class Components:</strong>These were more commonly used in earlier versions of React but are less common now due to the introduction of hooks in functional components. Class components are JavaScript classes that extend React.Component and must have a render() method that returns JSX.</li>
  <h3>Example:</h3>
  <pre>class Greeting extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {this.props.name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;
    }
  }
  </pre>
