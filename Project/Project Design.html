POST	/api/auth/register	Register new user
POST	/api/auth/login	Login and get token

PUT	/api/campaigns/:id	Update campaign (owner only)
DELETE	/api/campaigns/:id	Delete campaign (owner/admin)

Admin Routes
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/admin/users	Get all users (admin)
DELETE	/api/admin/:id	Delete user/campaign

 5. Database Design (MongoDB)

Users
js
Copy
Edit
{
  _id,
  name,
  email,
  passwordHash,
  role: 'user' | 'admin',
  createdAt
}


 Campaigns
js
Copy
Edit
{
  _id,
  title,
  description,
  image,
  goalAmount,
  raisedAmount,
  category,
  creator: ObjectId, // User
  status: 'active' | 'closed',
  createdAt
}


 Donations
js
Copy
Edit
{
  _id,
  campaignId: ObjectId,
  donorId: ObjectId,
  amount,
  paymentId, // Stripe
  createdAt
}


 6. Payment Flow (Stripe Integration)
User clicks “Donate”

React frontend hits /api/donations/create-payment-intent

Stripe returns clientSecret

Use @stripe/react-stripe-js for payment UI

Confirm payment → Save donation record in DB

 7. Auth Flow (JWT)
On login, server sends JWT

Store in localStorage or httpOnly cookie

Attach JWT in Authorization header for protected routes

Middleware checks token and user role

 8. Testing Plan
Unit Tests
React components (Jest + React Testing Library)

Node controllers (Mocha or Jest)

Integration Tests
Test API endpoints using Postman or Insomnia

 Manual Testing
All user flows: Registration → Campaign → Donation

9. Deployment Plan
Frontend: Vercel or Netlify

Backend: Render, Railway, or Heroku

MongoDB: MongoDB Atlas

Domains: Namecheap + Cloudflare (optional SSL/CDN)

10. Future Enhancements
Social login (Google, GitHub)

Campaign updates & blog posts

Comment system under campaigns

Notifications for donors

Wallet & recurring donations

Multi-language support
