    <p>Download ready-to-use compiled code for Bootstrap v4.0.0 to easily drop into your project, which includes:
    <li>Compiled and minified CSS bundles (see CSS files comparison).</li>
    <li>Compiled and minified JavaScript plugins</li>
    This doesn’t include documentation, source files, or any optional JavaScript dependencies (jQuery and Popper.js). </p>
    <h2>Source files</h2>
        <p>Compile Bootstrap with your own asset pipeline by downloading our source Sass, JavaScript, and documentation files. This option requires some additional tooling:
            <li>Sass compiler (Libsass or Ruby Sass is supported) for compiling your CSS.</li>
            <li>Autoprefixer for CSS vendor prefixing.</li>
            Should you require build tools, they are included for developing Bootstrap and its docs, but they’re likely unsuitable for your own purposes.</p>
            <li>Download jsDelivr, package managers.</li>
